...in which I'll discuss the philosophy of nihilism, the belief that nothing has meaning, and how existentialism answers that through the pursuit of authenticity.

Btw, authenticity as a philosophical concept is something I should talk about separately, because it's something society attempts to drill out of you, attempts to establish comformity. We do it to each other as children; remember, I was called a "boff", "gay" was thrown around as an insult, remember you saw that teen girl recently who was talking on the phone about other kids at school call her "terrorist" because she was South Asian. Societal and media depictions of the human condition that diminish individual characteristics are passed on by kids in ways that could make people ashamed of their authentic selves.
